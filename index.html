            <h2>What is the Xel Dynasty?</h2>
            <p>The Xel Dynasty is a large cluster of planets in a solary-system pattern similar to our own that exists on the edge of the Universe. It occupies many diverse planets and species, and is positioned around the NEXUS, a Dimensional Well build around the systems sun millenium ago by the Ancients eons ago.</p>
            
            <p>The Dimensional Well, codenamed NEXUS, is a gas giant-size super-transporter built by the Ancients eons ago. Its original purpose/intention is still unknown, but during the Modern Epoch, has become a super-hub for gathering all kinds of technology and weaponry - believed to be - from other dimensions. It rests in the neutral space of the Dynasty's borders but is mostly occupied by Xel military forces.</p>
